# How did Countries Respond to the Covid-19 Outbreak?

The new corona virus first emerged in China in December 2019 and has since spread across the world [source](https://www.sst.dk/da/Viden/Smitsomme-sygdomme/Smitsomme-sygdomme-A-AA/Coronavirus/Spoergsmaal-og-svar/Questions-and-answers)(accessed May 15 2020). Since then more than 300,000 people have died with Covid-19 worldwide. The image below shows the death count over time 

![total dead](https://github.com/MFHolm/socialData/blob/gh-pages/fig/total_dead.png?raw=true)

The plot shows that the death count was quite low and stable until around the 20'th of March when it took of and has grown steadily since. 

There is a huge difference in how badly different countries have been affected by the virus. Some countries have seen a huge death count and the hospitals have been and are still under a lot of pressure while other countries have been almost unaffected. 

The outbreak started in China but Europe and the US are now considered epicentres for the virus. The map below shows the geographical distribution of the death count around the world.

It is evident that Europe and the US are heavily affected. Now we will take a closer look at the countries with the highest death count. 


The graph below shows number of confirmed Covid-19 deaths by country for the 30 countries with the highest number of deaths. 

![dead by country](https://github.com/MFHolm/socialData/blob/gh-pages/fig/death_by_country.png?raw=true)

There are a few countries that dominate the graph namely: US, UK, Italy, France and Spain. These countries all have a death count of over 20,000 and the US has the highest death count of over 80,0000. 

However it is worth to note that the US has a much higher population than the other countries mentioned. The graph below shows the death count per million and it is quite a different picture. 



![dead by country](https://github.com/MFHolm/socialData/blob/gh-pages/fig/dead_per_mill_by_country.png?raw=true)

The plot shows that US has now moved all the way back to having the 8'th highest death count per million. When comparing countries it might be more relevant to use dead per million than total death count.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
